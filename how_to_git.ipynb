    "# How to use git:\n",
    "### Cloning a repository\n",
    "Once your environment is activated, use `git clone https://github.com/Parker03/intensity_slice` to clone the repository onto your pc, in your current directory. cd into the folder where the repository is located.\n",
    "### Identify yourself\n",
    "Git won't allow you to upload if it doesn't know your identity. Use the commands `git config --global user.name <username>` and `git config --global user.email <email>` to register your identity to the git program.\n",
    "### Create a new branch to edit\n",
    "`git checkout <branch>` is the command used to switch between branches. To create a new branch, use `git checkout -b <new branch name>`. The `-b` tells the computer to create a __new branch__.\n",
    "### Staging files\n",
    "When you want to (stage) mark a file to be committed in the next `commit`, use `git add <file>`.\n",
    "### Commit changes\n",
    "When you're ready to commit the changes, use `git commit -m \"description of change here\"` \n",
    "### Push changes to github\n",
    "Use `git push origin <branch name>` to push the changes you made in `<branch name>` to the repository you originally cloned."
